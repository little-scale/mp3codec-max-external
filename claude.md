# mp3codec~ - Claude Development Notes

## Project Overview

This MP3 codec external was developed in collaboration with Claude Code to create a real-time MP3 compression effect for Max/MSP. The goal was to apply authentic LAME MP3 compression artifacts to audio streams for creative sound design and lo-fi effects.

## Development History

### Initial Challenge
The user reported that MP3 compression at 56 kbps was "sounding far too good" and not producing the expected compression artifacts. This led to investigation of LAME configuration and discovery of more aggressive settings.

### Key Discoveries
1. **LAME Minimum Bitrate**: LAME enforces a 32 kbps minimum for CBR encoding - attempts to go lower are automatically clamped
2. **Aggressive Compression Settings**: Individual control over compression features provides better user experience than automatic application
3. **Crash Prevention**: Quality changes require careful thread synchronization (50ms delays) to prevent audio thread conflicts
4. **Latency Characteristics**: Total system latency is ~51ms (2256 samples @ 44.1kHz) due to LAME encoder/decoder delays plus buffering

### Architecture Evolution
The external evolved through several iterations:
1. Basic encode/decode with quality control
2. More aggressive LAME settings for extreme compression
3. Individual toggles for each compression feature
4. Comprehensive latency reporting and compensation
5. Robust crash prevention for parameter changes

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
- **LAME MP3 Encoder**: Uses libmp3lame.a for encoding with CBR mode
- **hip Decoder**: LAME's built-in decoder for immediate decoding
- **Ring Buffer System**: 4-frame ring buffer for output smoothing
- **Frame-based Processing**: 1152 samples per MP3 frame (MPEG1 standard)

### Individual Compression Controls
All aggressive settings are enabled by default for maximum compression artifacts:
- `lowpass`: 4kHz low-pass filter (telephone quality)
- `highpass`: 100Hz high-pass filter (bass reduction)
- `msstereo`: Forced mid/side stereo (collapses stereo image)
- `athonly`: ATH-only psychoacoustic model (heavy quantization noise)
- `experimental`: LAME's most aggressive experimental modes
- `emphasis`: Pre-emphasis (metallic coloration)

### Bitrate Mapping
Quality levels 0-9 map to bitrates: {320, 256, 192, 160, 128, 112, 96, 64, 40, 32} kbps

## Development Challenges Solved

### Crash Prevention
**Problem**: Quality changes caused crashes during audio processing
**Solution**: 
- Disable processing first (`x->initialized = 0`)
- 50ms thread synchronization delay
- Validate state before reinitializing
- Graceful fallback to previous quality on failure

### Insufficient Compression Artifacts
**Problem**: Lower bitrates weren't producing expected artifacts
**Solution**:
- Individual control over all aggressive LAME settings
- Proper CBR configuration (not VBR)
- Corrected bitrate mapping based on LAME's actual limits
- Disabled bit reservoir for lower latency

### Latency Management
**Problem**: Unknown system latency affecting real-time performance
**Solution**:
- Detailed latency calculation and reporting
- Separate tracking of encoder, decoder, and buffer delays
- Real-time latency analysis via `latency` message
- Optional delay compensation (disabled for debugging)

## Code Organization

### Key Functions
- `mp3codec_init_processor()`: Complete LAME setup with user toggles
- `mp3codec_perform64()`: Real-time audio processing with frame buffering
- `mp3codec_quality()`: Thread-safe quality changes with crash prevention
- Individual toggle functions: `mp3codec_lowpass()`, `mp3codec_msstereo()`, etc.
- `mp3codec_latency()`: Comprehensive latency analysis and reporting

### Memory Management
- Uses Max SDK memory functions (`sysmem_newptr`, `sysmem_freeptr`)
- Careful cleanup in `mp3codec_cleanup_processor()`
- NULL pointer checks throughout
- Safe state management during reinitialization

## Build Configuration

### Dependencies
- **libmp3lame.a**: Static linking for ARM64 architecture
- **Max SDK**: Standard MSP external headers and libraries
- **CMake**: Universal binary build system

### CMakeLists.txt Key Features
```cmake
# Link LAME library statically
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} 
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/libmp3lame.a
)

# Universal binary for Mac compatibility
cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="x86_64;arm64" ..
```

## Usage Patterns

### Creative Applications
- **Lo-fi Effects**: Quality 7-9 with all aggressive settings
- **Telephone Simulation**: Enable only lowpass + highpass
- **Stereo Width Control**: Use msstereo toggle
- **Bandwidth Limiting**: Selective frequency reduction

### Technical Applications
- **Codec Education**: Demonstrate MP3 compression artifacts
- **Latency Testing**: Built-in latency measurement tools
- **Algorithm Analysis**: Individual setting isolation

## Performance Characteristics

### CPU Usage
- Lower quality levels use more CPU (complex psychoacoustic models)
- Individual toggles may be more efficient than combined settings
- Bypass mode available for CPU-intensive patches

### Latency Breakdown
- LAME Encoder: ~576 samples (13.1ms)
- LAME Decoder: ~528 samples (12.0ms)
- Buffer Latency: 1152 samples (26.1ms)
- **Total**: ~2256 samples (51.2ms @ 44.1kHz)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Variable Bitrate (VBR) Support**: Currently uses CBR only
2. **Multi-channel Support**: Currently stereo-only
3. **Sample Rate Flexibility**: Optimized for 44.1kHz
4. **Additional Psychoacoustic Models**: Beyond ATH-only
5. **Real-time Quality Morphing**: Smooth transitions between quality levels

### Known Limitations
- 32 kbps minimum bitrate (LAME limitation)
- Fixed 2-channel processing
- Quality changes require brief reinitialization
- Sample rate changes trigger full processor reset

## Development Lessons

### Key Insights
1. **Real-time Audio Safety**: Never allocate/deallocate in perform routine
2. **Thread Synchronization**: Audio and main threads require careful coordination
3. **Parameter Validation**: Always validate LAME configuration success
4. **User Experience**: Individual controls beat automatic aggressive settings
5. **Documentation Importance**: Comprehensive help and technical reference essential

### Best Practices Applied
- Extensive error checking and graceful degradation
- Clear separation of audio and control logic
- Detailed logging for debugging and user feedback
- Universal binary builds for maximum compatibility
- Following Max SDK conventions for memory and threading
